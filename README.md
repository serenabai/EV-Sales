# Analyzing EV Sales and Predicting EV Sale Price

## Introduction

Returning to my birth city of Beijing for the first time in two years, I couldn't help but notice the massive increase in the amount of electric vehicles on the city streets. With their unmistakable green license plates and recognizable logos, EVs in China now make up more than half of the world's sales, with a quarter of cars manufactured in China being electric or hybrid vehicles as of 2022. Although Tesla has planted itself solidly at the top of the China EV industry, most of its closest competitors are actually Chinese car companies including BYD and Geely, who have yet to aggressively expand internationally. 

I began this project with the goal of gaining an understanding of the EV industry, especially the factors that go into pricing and the main drivers of sales. 

## Data Collection

In order to obtain the most up to date data on electric cars available internationally, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape 335 EVs from ev-database.org, a fairly comprehensive website cataloguing EVs available in Europe along with several key metrics, including Range, Efficiency, Body Type, Charger, and other important characteristics of electric vehicles. 

I also used EV sales data from US and Europe obtained from afdc.energy.gov/data and insideevs.com.
